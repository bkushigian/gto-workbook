# Semibluffs and Protection
## Scenario 1: BB Calls BN Open
Blinds are $0.05/$0.10. Effective stacks are $10.00. You're on the button and
action folds to you. You open for $0.30 (3bb), SB folds, and BB calls. You go to
the flop with $9.70 behind and a pot of $0.65, and BB checks to you.
### Flop 1: <b>A<span style="color:#000000;">&spades;</span>T<span style="color:#0088ff;">&diams;</span>5<span style="color:#008800;">&clubs;</span></b>
1. **Approximate each player's equity. Who has the equity advantage?**

   The button has a significant equity advantage on this flop, probably about 55%.

2. **What are the weakest hands that could go all in on the flop? Go for
   three streets of value on blank turns?**

   The some two pair like AT, A5, and maybe even T5, should be willing to go all in on this flop.

   Top pair top kicker can go for three streets, and maybe get all in on this flop?

3. **Which player has the nuts advantage?**

   The button has a clear nuts advantage.

4. **How static or dynamic is this flop? What aspects of this flop make it
   more static or dynamic?  How do these aspects interact with one another?**

   This is a very static flop. It is rainbow with a high card and no straights on board. There are some gutshots but most of these belong to the button who already has the equity and nuts advantage, so turns like a KQJ won't change benefit the big blind's range.

5. **On this flop do you prefer to bet small or large?  With what
   frequencies would you check and bet?**

   If we cbet small and BB calls we are happy to see any KQJ. Worst cards are a ten or a 5.

6. **Say you adopt a strategy where you either bet with your preferred
   sizing or check. You choose to bet and villain calls. What are the best and
   worst turn cards for your range?**

   I prefer a small cbet with 100% frequency.
