# Semibluffs and Protection
## Scenario 1: BB Calls BN Open
Blinds are $0.05/$0.10. Effective stacks are $10.00. You're on the button and
action folds to you. You open for $0.30 (3bb), SB folds, and BB calls. You go to
the flop with $9.70 behind and a pot of $0.65, and BB checks to you.

### Flop 1: <b>A<span style="color:#000000;">&spades;</span>T<span style="color:#0088ff;">&diams;</span>5<span style="color:#008800;">&clubs;</span></b>

1. **Approximate each player's equity. Who has the equity advantage?**

   The button has a significant equity advantage on this flop, probably about 55%.

2. **What are the weakest hands that could go all in on the flop? Go for
   three streets of value on blank turns?**

   The some two pair like AT, A5, and maybe even T5, should be willing to go all in on this flop.

   Top pair top kicker can go for three streets, and maybe get all in on this flop?

3. **Which player has the nuts advantage?**

   The button has a clear nuts advantage.

4. **How static or dynamic is this flop? What aspects of this flop make it
   more static or dynamic?  How do these aspects interact with one another?**

   This is a very static flop. It is rainbow with a high card and no straights on board. There are some gutshots but most of these belong to the button who already has the equity and nuts advantage, so turns like a KQJ won't change benefit the big blind's range.

5. **On this flop do you prefer to bet small or large?  With what
   frequencies would you check and bet?**

   If we cbet small and BB calls we are happy to see any KQJ. Worst cards are a ten or a 5.

6. **Say you adopt a strategy where you either bet with your preferred
   sizing or check. You choose to bet and villain calls. What are the best and
   worst turn cards for your range?**

   I prefer a small cbet with 100% frequency.
#### Hands
1. <b>J<span style="color:#008800;">&clubs;</span>T<span style="color:#ff0000;">&hearts;</span></b> (Flop: A<span style="color:#000000;">&spades;</span>T<span style="color:#0088ff;">&diams;</span>5<span style="color:#008800;">&clubs;</span>)
    1. **If you bet this hand should you expect better hands to fold?**

       No.

    2. **If you bet this hand should you expect worse hands to call?**

       Yes. BB should be calling with ands like T6s-T8s, some low pocket pairs,
       some 5x, and some drawing hands.

    3. **Does this hand benefit from a protection bet?**

       Yes. BB has a bunch of hands Kx, Qx, Jx that we would like to clear out.
       They will have a hard time standing up to a bet, and this will make KQJ
       turns a lot safer for us.

    4. **Does this hand benefit from growing the pot?**

       No. This hand is a medium strength hand and wants to get to showdown for cheap.
       There are some turn/rivers where this hand is nutted (TJ, QK) but those are rare
       and this hand shouldn't play with those in mind.

    5. **How is this hand doing if you bet and get called?**

       This hand should be doing fine but not great. Since our range is betting
       wide BB will have to defend with some weaker holdings, and this  hand
       can profit off of those. However it probably doesn't want to bet for
       another street of value, since after bet-call, bet-call villain's range
       will start to look pretty strong.

    6. **How is this hand doing against a check-raise?**

       Not well. I think we call, but we are in a bad spot. We might fold this
       as well. Against a balanced opponent I think we call.

    7. **What are this hand's incentives on this flop? Does it want to bet or check? If it wants to bet, what sizing does it prefer?**

        Bet small. This hand values protection but doesn't want to grow the
        pot.  Therefore this hand wants to bet small to fold out some of
        villain's equity and get called by some worse hands. On most later
        streets, villain wants to try to get to showdown cheaply.

    8. **Suppose you take your preferred action (check or bet the preferred size). If this is a bet, suppose villain calls. What are the best and worst turn cards for this hand?**

        If this hand bets small and BB calls we are happy to see any T or J
        since those both improve our hand, beating a lot of the hands that were
        ahead of us (Ax, QT).  An ace is also good because it blocks a lot of
        villains top pairs.

        We really don't want to see a 5, and in general lower cards might
        connect with  a random pocket pair. We don't mind seeing a K or Q
        since our range offers us some protection and we folded out a lot
        of their Kx/Qx on the flop.


2. <b>K<span style="color:#000000;">&spades;</span>7<span style="color:#008800;">&clubs;</span></b> (Flop: A<span style="color:#000000;">&spades;</span>T<span style="color:#0088ff;">&diams;</span>5<span style="color:#008800;">&clubs;</span>)
    1. **If you bet this hand should you expect better hands to fold?**

        Yes, a few. BB might fold some like K8s or K9o. We probably won't fold
        out any pairs, and since villain doesn't really have many non-made hands
        with more showdown value than this hand we probably won't get too many
        better hands to fold.

    2. **If you bet this hand should you expect worse hands to call?**

        BB might call with like 43s w/ a backdoor flush draw, but those have
        plenty of equity against us...I wouldn't really call that hand worse.

    3. **Does this hand benefit from a protection bet?**

       Yes. King high can win at showdown unimproved but most turn cards, especially
       lower turn cards, can connect with villain's range in random ways. We won't
       be putting much more money in the pot so folding out random suited
       connectors and 1-gappers is to our benefit.

    4. **Does this hand benefit from growing the pot?**

        Absolutely not! This hand wants to get to showdown for free.

    5. **How is this hand doing if you bet and get called?**

        So-so. Villain should call with some worse unpaired hands that are drawing (like Kd4d).
        We also have pretty good equity against a 5x, having two overs and some
        a backdoor straight draw

    6. **How is this hand doing against a check-raise?**

        Very bad. We fold.

    7. **What are this hand's incentives on this flop? Does it want to bet or check? If it wants to bet, what sizing does it prefer?**

        On its own this hand wants to check and get to showdown. In the context
        of our range, however, we want to push equity by betting small.

    8. **Suppose you take your preferred action (check or bet the preferred size). If this is a bet, suppose villain calls. What are the best and worst turn cards for this hand?**

        Best cards for us are any K and any 7. The 7 improves us above their
        bottom pair, and K improves us against their Tx and 5x. We are probably
        also happy to see an A and maybe a T? 
        
        An A is good because it blocks top pair which we are unlikely to beat.
        Similarly, a T is good because it blocks some of their middle pairs,
        making our K-high relatively stronger. However, if they _do_ have a T
        in their hand and we hit a K on the river we are in trouble.
        
        J and Q give us a gutter but also connect with some of their calling
        hands.

        We don't want to see a 5 since that connects with their range much more
        than ours. Similarly we don't want to see lower cards like 2, 3, 4, 6,
        or 7 since those connect with villains range more.


3. <b>A<span style="color:#0088ff;">&diams;</span>T<span style="color:#008800;">&clubs;</span></b> (Flop: A<span style="color:#000000;">&spades;</span>T<span style="color:#0088ff;">&diams;</span>5<span style="color:#008800;">&clubs;</span>)
    1. **If you bet this hand should you expect better hands to fold?**

        No.

    2. **If you bet this hand should you expect worse hands to call?**

        Yes. We are ahead of almost all of their range save for bottom set, and
        they call a significant portion of the time. This is a great value bet.

    3. **Does this hand benefit from a protection bet?**

        No. There are some random draws that might get there, but that will
        happen pretty infrequently. Hands that have good equity against ours
        won't fold to a bet.

    4. **Does this hand benefit from growing the pot?**

        Yes. This hand wants to play for stacks.

    5. **How is this hand doing if you bet and get called?**

        Very well.

    6. **How is this hand doing against a check-raise?**

        Very well.

    7. **What are this hand's incentives on this flop? Does it want to bet or check? If it wants to bet, what sizing does it prefer?**

        This hand wants to bet, and it wants to bet a larger size.

    8. **Suppose you take your preferred action (check or bet the preferred size). If this is a bet, suppose villain calls. What are the best and worst turn cards for this hand?**

        Best cards are A and T. Worst card is probably a 5. We could also be
        worried about some gutshots coming in (so like a K, or a 2,3,4) but I
        don't think those are of much concern.

4. <b>7<span style="color:#008800;">&clubs;</span>6<span style="color:#008800;">&clubs;</span></b> (Flop: A<span style="color:#000000;">&spades;</span>T<span style="color:#0088ff;">&diams;</span>5<span style="color:#008800;">&clubs;</span>)
    1. **If you bet this hand should you expect better hands to fold?**

        Yes. Some cards with better high cards will fold out some showdown
        equity against us. However, I don't know if those are 'better' hands...
        Our hand doesn't win unimproved but it benefits from a lot of turns: it
        has the option to polarize on any club as well as any 3, 4, 8, or 9, and gains
        showdown on a 7 or a 6.


    2. **If you bet this hand should you expect worse hands to call?**

        No.

    3. **Does this hand benefit from a protection bet?**

        No. It has no showdown to protect

    4. **Does this hand benefit from growing the pot?**

        Not unimproved. It likes a deeper SPR since it is drawing.

    5. **How is this hand doing if you bet and get called?**

        Not particularly well, but we benefit from leverage and position, and this
        hand can triple barrel on a lot of runouts.

    6. **How is this hand doing against a check-raise?**

        This hand is a semi-bluff and does poorly against a check-raise.

    7. **What are this hand's incentives on this flop? Does it want to bet or check? If it wants to bet, what sizing does it prefer?**

        This hand wants to bet big. It is bottom of range and it wants to
        polarize to get any fold equity it can. It also wants to be ready to put
        stacks in depending on runout.

    8. **Suppose you take your preferred action (check or bet the preferred size). If this is a bet, suppose villain calls. What are the best and worst turn cards for this hand?**

        Best turn cards are 8c and 4c. Other than that:
        + Any club (FD)
        + Any 4 or 8 (OESD)
        + A 7 or a 6
